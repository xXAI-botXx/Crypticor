# Cryptify ðŸ”’ðŸ‘€
> Cryptify your digital communication!



Simple Program for easy use of cryptography with a simple GUI.

Goal is that everyone can easily encrypt messages with that application. It's not structered for commercial use. More for "fun"

 use. But it should really work and it should be secure. You also can use the private and public keys for signature.



Features: 

- Create Private and Public keys (and saving in cache)
- Local safe of public and private keys
- Encrypt messages (and saving in cache)
- Decrypt messages (and saving in cache)
- GUI for the usage
- Windows App
- Android App
- Adding more than only Strings as data? 



---

### To Do:

- program the fundamental cryptify python file
  - Add Encrypt and Decrypt mechanism (with AES and RSA)
  - Add local safe (with keyring modul)
  - Add password-security & management of keys 
    - Password for the system (optional)
  - Add active private and public key system -> there can be always one public and one private be active
- Add licence (MIT?)
- GUI programming for Android and Windows
- Porting for Android and Windows (publishing in PlayStore + exe download or adding in WindowsStore)
- Complete Documentation

### Choice of Encrypt-Library

There are several good options for cryptgraphy-libs in python. Following there is a list of existing (commonly used) cryptgraphy-libraries in Python. 

- [crypt](https://docs.python.org/3/library/crypt.html)
- [bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/)
- [PyCrypto](https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/)
- [cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/)
- [Passlib](https://pypi.org/project/passlib/)
- [PyNaCl](https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/)



It is not recommend to implement such algorithms by yourself. Therefore **PyNaCl** will be used in this project for the cryptography.

It's a library which efforts all needed features and is a Python Binding of the popular [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) library which is written in C.

### Usage

- how to send and read a message crypted/securely?
- how to send a signature and how to check a signature?
